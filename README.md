- "Today's programming wisdom is to focus on writing clean, maintainable, and reusable code. It's not just about solving the problem at hand, but also about ensuring that your code can be easily understood and modified in the future. This means using clear and descriptive variable names, commenting your code, and breaking it down into small, modular functions. Remember, code is read far more often than it is written, so always strive to make your code as readable as possible."
